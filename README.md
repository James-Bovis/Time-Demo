# Time Demo
This small project was built as a small personal project for myself to get to
know the [`moment`](https://momentjs.com/) API and to also take what I've
learned about React in the last few months and put it to the test by creating a
small App from scratch.

By also using [`react-gradient`](https://github.com/JonKelley88/react-gradient)
I was able to create a nice soothing screen which generates an applicable
greeting and the current Date/Time.

## Project Information

This project was built using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test` | `yarn test`
